# Microbial Community Storm Dynamics

This repo contains code and data used to develop the analysis of microbial community dynamics in response to stream event flow over the course of a major early-season precipitation event on the Marys River in Oregon, USA, as described in the article: 

URycki, D. R., Good, S.P., Crump, B.C., Ceperley, N., Brooks, J.R. (2024) "Microbial community storm dynamics signal sources of 'old' stream water." PLOS ONE. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0306896

To run this analysis:
1. Fork, clone, or download the repo.
2. Load necessary Python libraries -OR- create a virtual environment using the file 'microbe-hydrograph_env.yml'
3. Run the desired script.
